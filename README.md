### Hi there, I'm Alfonso Pinzón

I’m an Electronics engineering student based in Guatemala.
My main skills include the development of embedded systems, with a focus on PCB design using tools like KiCad and Altium, as well as the assembly process with 
through-hole and SMD components.
Here you will find all the repositories for all of my hardware projects and what I'm currently working.

### My Blog.
This is the place where I post about my project with more details about the process, from project conception to troubleshooting, testing, programming
and the assembly process.
