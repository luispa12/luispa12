### Hi there, I'm Alfonso Pinzón

I’m an Electronics engineering student based in Guatemala.
My main skills include the development of embedded systems, with a focus on PCB design using tools like KiCad and Altium, as well as the assembly process with 
through-hole and SMD components.
From project conception to troubleshooting, testing, and programming, I enjoy every step of the process and embrace the challenges it presents.
This is the space where I share my projects, experiences, and challenges in the fascinating world of electronics.
